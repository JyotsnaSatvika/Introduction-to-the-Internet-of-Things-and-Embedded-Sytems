Q1). Identify and analyze a device that is an IoT device now, but in the past was a non-IoT device. Describe and list the features of the device.
    Compare the functions of the device in the past to the functions of the device now. 

A1). The toothbrush is used for cleaning our teeth daily. The majority of dental problems are arising only because of not clean our teeth regularly. 
     Recently smart toothbrushes came into the picture by keeping in view of children who cannot brush their teeth, senior citizens who depend on others, 
     also people who are not having enough time and patience to spend some more time on their teeth.

     Features of smart tooth brush
1).  Records all your brushing data like how much time you are spending for it, how much pressure you are applying, what are the places you are not reaching,
     bacteria satus, and lot more through an app.
2).  It is also having a fantastic feature to vibrate in 3d mode all what you have to do is just keep it in contact with our teeth at all points the rest activities
     are taken care by the tooth brush itself.
3).  The interesting thing is that we can vibrate it at different speeds, so that the person with sensitive gums can use the low speed,similarly the person can select
     the speed corresponding to his oral health, we can also customize the speed of you are not satisfied with the given options
    
     Previously there is no one to monitor our oral health, we should go for a check-up to knowing our dental condition. but now everything is in a matter of minutes you 
     get updates daily about your condition. Usually, children are not interested in brushing their teeth but now the app has designed few games for changing their mindset.
     slowly children will be deviated and start liking to brush their teeth.

     persons teeth regulary and taking corresponding care to protect their teeth.

     Coming to the limitations of the device the cost is one of the factor which stops it going into the people as it is an electronic device its cost will definitly be more 
     than a normal toothbrush. onemore limitation is its maintanence we cannot use it rough and tough as we use our normal tooth brush we need to use it with more care such

Q4). Describe any privacy issues with the IoT device that never existed in the original version of the device. Compare the price of the original device to the price of the 
     new IoT version of the device. When performing a price comparison, attempt to normalize for the changing value of currency over time by using an online inflation 
     calculator.

     in spending on it where as the IOT device starts from hundreds which every one cannot afford for a tooth brush.
